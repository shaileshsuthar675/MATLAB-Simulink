 - **Inventor & OnShape:** for building the assembly of clubfoot and integrate with MATLAB

**Hardware**
 - Stepper motors: getting installed on each pivot point of clubfoot
 - Arduino
 - Jumper wires
 - Battery
 - Breadboard

## ROOT DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING CLUBFFOT ORTHOSIS
 - Replaced the legacy worm and worm gear actuation system with precision stepper motor integration at critical pivot points.
 - Developed an advanced orthotic system capable of predicting biomechanical foot trajectory correction with high accuracy.
 - Utilized MATLAB to model and simulate the orthosis's optimal rehabilitation path and movement trajectory.

## REASULTS AND DISCUSSION
 - Conducted kinematic analysis of 2-DOF, 3-DOF, and 6-DOF mechanisms for clubfoot orthosis using forward and inverse kinematics approaches
 - Utilized waypoint analysis to generate precise end-effector movement, revealing smooth velocity profiles with minimal error
 - Demonstrated successful trajectory prediction for 2 and 3 DOF mechanisms through straightforward kinematic modeling
 - Addressed complex 6-DOF kinematic challenges in unilateral clubfoot orthosis design, achieving accurate biomechanical correction aligned with Ponseti method principles
 - Validated the feasibility of advanced 6-DOF kinematic strategies for orthotic device development

## CONCLUSION

The study started with a detailed investigation of the CTEV condition, current treatment
options, existing CTEV orthosis designs, and the concept behind the orthosis design. Kinematic
Simulation of 6-DOF Clubfoot (CTEV) Corrective Orthosis has been carried out in this study
for the primary objective to design a highly functional CTEV orthosis addressing the
biomechanical understanding of the Ponseti method. The following conclusions are drawn to
improve the functionality of the 6-DOF CTEV orthosis mechanism and investigate the scope
of implementing automation in it.


- Developed an automated orthosis trajectory identification using inverse kinematics to precisely determine joint step angles for actuation
- Implemented a forward kinematics model to enable physician manual intervention and control
- Designed a preliminary prototype focusing on universal accessibility and adaptability
- Integrated anthropometric studies of clubfoot to enable dynamic shape and size modifications within the kinematic mechanism
- Proposed strategic design modifications to incorporate advanced sensor and motor technologies into the orthotic system
